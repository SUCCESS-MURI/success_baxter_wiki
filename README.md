# success_baxter_wiki

A wiki for maintaining documentation and working code for baxter-kinect calibration stuff.
Also includes code for basic pick-and-place task using move-it.

**Note:** All the code is tested on *Python 3, ROS Melodic, Kinect v2 and Ubuntu Bionic Beaver*. As a practice, separate branches and notes for backward compatibility will be maintained only ahead of these base versions and not for before.
